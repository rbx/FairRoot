FairRoot software
========

The FairRoot framework is fully based on the ROOT system. 
The user can create simulated data and/or perform analysis with the same framework. 
Moreover, Geant3 and Geant4 transport engines are supported, however the user code that creates simulated data
do not depend on a particular monte carlo engine. The framework delivers base classes which enable the users to 
construct their detectors and /or analysis tasks in a simple way, it also delivers some general functionality
like track visualization. Moreover an interface for reading magnetic field maps is also implemented.

new line :)
